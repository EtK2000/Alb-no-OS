# Albÿno OS

This is the home of my OS for ComputerCraft.

  - working "apt-get" with addable repos (the repos have a simple format)
  - file explorer based on FileX
  - very basic KDE-like desktop (think Windows)
  - configurable default programs
  - programs can register formats that they can open
  - a bunch of shell jargon that most people don't care about
  - basic multi-user login system
  - basic filesystem protection
  - auto-update (configurable)

## Installation

replace &lt;disk/startup&gt; with whatever location you want, but is needs to be on a disk.<br>
<br>
You can either download
from [github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EtK2000/Alb-no-OS/master/installer) (the most recent version):
### wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EtK2000/Alb-no-OS/master/installer &lt;disk/startup&gt;<br>
or from [my site](http://cc.etk2000.com/albÿno/src/installer) (the most recent stable version):
### wget http://cc.etk2000.com/alb%C3%BFno/src/installer &lt;disk/startup&gt;

Now just run &lt;disk/startup&gt;.
